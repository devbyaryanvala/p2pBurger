# p2pBurger Project Documentation 🍔

---

## Overview
**p2pBurger** is a **filesharing application** developed by devbyaryanvala. It leverages **WebRTC** technology to facilitate direct **peer-to-peer file transfers** 🤝.

---

## Technologies Used
The project is primarily built using:
* **HTML** 📄 (83.9%)
* **JavaScript** 💻 (16.1%)

---

## Features
* **Peer-to-Peer Filesharing**: Utilizes WebRTC for direct communication between peers, enabling efficient file transfers without relying on a central server for data exchange 🚀.

## Setup and Local Execution
Currently, detailed instructions on how to set up and run the p2pBurger project locally are not available 🚧. To get the project running, you would typically need to:

1.  **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/devbyaryanvala/p2pBurger.git](https://github.com/devbyaryanvala/p2pBurger.git)
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
    ```bash
    cd p2pBurger
    ```
3.  **Local Server**: Since the project uses HTML and JavaScript, it likely requires a local web server to run correctly (e.g., using Python's `http.server`, Node.js's `serve`, or Live Server extension in VS Code) 🌐.
4.  **WebRTC Requirements**: As a WebRTC application, it might have specific requirements for establishing peer connections, such as STUN/TURN servers for NAT traversal, though basic functionality might work on a local network without them 🚦.

For more information, you may need to refer directly to the source code on the [p2pBurger GitHub repository](https://github.com/devbyaryanvala/p2pBurger) 🧑‍💻.
